I ended up writing the CLI Test Util and the Send Inputs to CLI Util because I realized midway through building the `create-github-project` generator that I need a way to test my CLIs.

Luckily, I've written a version of this before so I know what's needed. I'm not going to go too deeply into how this is built, but just know you have a tool to test your CLIs :)
