It seems that nobody reads prefaces, especially in "technical" material such as this one. I'm guilty of that. I just want the facts, the list of `bash` commands I have to run and list of `npm` packages I have to install. With the volume of information out there and tight deadlines, I was conditioned to glaze over explanations, especially non-technical back story. So I'll give you the tl;dr;

And before we start, I welcome all comments, questions, thoughts, and improvements! Please email me at [toli@tolicodes.com](mailto:toli@tolicodes.com), Slack me (if you're at HOVER), or in the spirit of just write a Github Issue or PR :P.

It's quite long so depending on your interests and available free time I would recommend reading:

## Show Me the Code!

If you **just want the facts, the list of commands, and the strategies I've identified to solve specific problems**, I totally understand, I won't feel hurt ðŸ˜‰. Feel free to skip to the 1st chapter of the book [Building InfraGen](./building-infragen).

It goes into plenty of detail with real examples of how I recommend developing applications. It dog-foods the development of InfraGen itself, explaining how certain choices were made, as well as the commands I ran and the code I wrote to **solve specific problems**.

## Technical Principles

If you're interested in just the general technical principles I identified, you can skip to the [Technical Principles](https://principles.tolicodes.com/docs/technical-principles) portion of the Principals Repo. I will refer to them throughout the book, so it might be worth a skim over.

## Life Principles

If you are interested in my general philosophy, what I learned about myself during my retreat, that's all in the [Life Principles](https://principles.tolicodes.com/docs/life-principles) section. It details not just my philosophy towards programming, but life at large.

## How I Got There

Wow, you really love to read! The [How I Got There](https://principles.tolicodes.com/docs/how-i-got-there) section gives you a look into how I arrived to some of these principles. Well really, just a tiny tiny portion of the much larger story. Sometimes the journey is far more important than the destination!
